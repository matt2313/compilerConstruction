# Types
MattC supports `int` and `bool` literals.

## Int
An `int` represents a single signed integer.
To create an `int` literal, simply write a number in base 10 with no decimal place. A `-` can be added to the start of the number to make it negative. For example, the following lines all create int literals:
```
1;
13;
27;
10345;
-15;
-12;
```

## Bool
A `bool` represents a single `true` or `false` value.
`bool` literals can be created by writing the keywords `true` or `false` in lower case.
```
true;
false;
```
