# Types
Currently MattC only supports `int` literals

## Int
To create an `int` literal, simply write the number in base 10 with no decimal place. A `-` can be added to the start of the number to make it negative. For example, the following lines all create int literals:
```
1;
13;
27;
10345;
-15;
-12;
```
