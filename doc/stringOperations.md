# String Operations

## Concatenation
The `^` operator returns a `string` consisting of the caracters from its left operand followed by the caracters from its right operand. It is an infix operator, so it is placed in between its operands.
```
"hello " ^ "world"; // hello world
"test" ^ ""; // test
"this " ^ "can " ^ "be " ^ "chained " ^ "together." // this can be chained together.
```
